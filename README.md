# Supervised-Machine-Learning
Using Machine learning classification to predict hotel cancellations. To help the hotel achieve non realised profit, the aim is for us to focus on specifying recall as our scoring parameter in order to maximise the number of cancellations our model can essentially catch.

I used a RandomForest classifier as it was the most accurate on our training data. Unfortunately due to a lack of time and because of the large data set I did not have time to make use of multiple GridSearch Parameters to find the ideal hyperparameters. I therefore used a default hyperparameter.

For future refinements of this project I'd love to tune the hyperparameters more to improve performance. I'd also like to try a logistic regression algorithm to compare performances on the training data.

Overall, this project in my opinion still brought commercial value and is one that generates profit by capturing unrealised profit, lost during, in this case, the busiest months.
